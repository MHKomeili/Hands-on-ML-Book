 Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow is a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=pd_sbs_1/145-3629391-8587918?pd_rd_w=NQj95&pf_rd_p=3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&pf_rd_r=JHK19PCFQWE054EJCTTD&pd_rd_r=e1e0b6dc-1f7f-453c-9384-13e4718aff5e&pd_rd_wg=zjO4t&pd_rd_i=1492032646&psc=1) written by Aurelien Geron, published by O'Reilly, is one of the best books for gaining both theoretical and practical experience in Machine Learning and Deep Learning fields.
  
 Here, we use the second edition of the book also upgraded for TensorFlow2.
  
 The book is divided in to two main parts in order to cover both the fundamental of machine learning and also neural networks and deep learning.
 Also there is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RiFIYwuwHM) about the book that you can watch in YouTube
