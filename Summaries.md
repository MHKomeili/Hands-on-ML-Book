I am going to share my summaries with other readers so they might help other learners :)

Summaries are being written in markdown files via [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) application so in order to easily manage, read, link, ... these files, you can download it.

All of the files will be available on my personal GitHub account via the [Hands-on-ML] repository
